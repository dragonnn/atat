`#![no_std]` crate for parsing AT commands ([Hayes command set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayes_command_set))

A driver support crate for AT-command based serial modules.

## AT Best practices

This crate attempts to work from these AT best practices:

> - The DTE shall flush the AT channel (i.e. check if there are data waiting to be read) before sending a new AT command
> - The DTE shall detect/process complete lines (see the S3, S4 and V0/V1 settings), so they can be processed with a function that handles responses
> - The DTE shall handle the case of unexpected spaces or line endings
> - The DTE shall handle all the URCs: it can simply ignore them (not suggested) or, better, take a proper action
> - The DTE shall know what answer is expected and shall wait until it is received (i.e. final result code only or informationtext response + final result code)
> - The final result code marks the end of an AT command and can be OK, ERROR or ABORTED: when the final result is an error, be sure to handle it before continuing with the next AT command
> - The information text response format is command specific. The DTE will need explicit handling for each one. It is suggested to consult the u-blox AT Commands Manual [1]
> - It is suggested not to strictly parse information text responses but to checkif they contain interesting keywords and/or parameters
> - The DTE shall know if the issued AT command can be aborted or not
> - Some AT commands could output the final result code after some seconds, in this case check on AT manual for the suggested estimated response time. If the timeout expires then a decision should be taken accordingly: e.g. if the command can be aborted then try to abort it, etc ...
> - It is very useful, for debugging an application, to log all the command lines sent to the DCE and what is received from it
> - Create a state machine for the AT parser (i.e. idle, waiting_response, data_mode)
> - The DTE shall wait some time (the recommended value is at least 20 ms) after the reception of an AT command final response or URC before issuing a new AT commandto give the module the opportunity to transmit the buffered URCs. Otherwise the collision of the URCs with the subsequent AT command is still possible
> - The DTE shall be aware that, when using a serial port without HW flow control, the first character is used to wake up the module from power saving

## [Documentation](https://docs.rs/atat/latest)

## Tests

> The crate is covered by tests. These tests can be run by `cargo test --tests`, and are run by the CI on every push.

## Examples

The crate has examples for usage with [embassy] for `#![no_std]` and [tokio] for `std`.

The samples can be built using `cargo +nightly run --bin embassy --features embedded --target thumbv6m-none-eabi` and `cargo +nightly run --example std-tokio --features std`.

Furthermore the crate has been used to build initial drivers for U-Blox cellular modules ([ublox-cellular-rs]) and U-Blox short-range modules ([ublox-short-range-rs])

## Releasing to crates.io

This workspace uses `cargo-release` to do workspace releases to crates.io. It can be installed through cargo with `cargo install cargo-release`. The steps involved in a new release are:

1. Run `cargo release --dry-run -- major|minor|patch`, and verify the output
2. Run `cargo release -- major|minor|patch`, to release

## About

- Minimum rustc version 1.79
- Tested and built using stable toolchain

## Supported Crates

The following dependent crates provide platform-agnostic device drivers built on `embedded-hal` which also implement this crate's traits:

## Features

- `derive`: Enabled by default. Re-exports `atat_derive` to allow deriving `Atat__` traits.
- `bytes`: Enabled by default. Re-exports `serde-bytes` & `heapless-bytes` to allow serializing & deserializing non-quoted byte slices correctly.
- `log`: Disabled by default. Enable log statements on various log levels to aid debugging. Powered by `log`.
- `defmt`: Disabled by default. Enable defmt log statements on various log levels to aid debugging. Powered by `defmt`.
- `custom-error-messages`: Disabled by default. Allows errors to contain custom error messages up to 64 characters, parsed by `AtDigest::custom_error`.
- `hex_str_arrays`: Disabled by default. Needs `#![feature(generic_const_exprs)]` Nightly feature. This allows for hex strings to be serialized to a fix-width byte array.
- `heapless`: Enable heapless feature on `serde_at`. This enables heapless support and adds some specialized parsing structs.
